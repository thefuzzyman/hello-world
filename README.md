# hello-world!
==============

This is my first ever GitHub repository. I've always navigated around Git, but I've finally decided to buckle down and learn it properly now that I am becoming a more serious programmer. At the moment, my languages of preference are Python and C/C++. Overall, I am still pretty much a beginner programmer though. 

What will end up here in my hello-world repository? At the moment, I've no idea, I'm just following a tutorial right now. I will be working with the Panda3D game engine soon, though, and I'll probably make a new repository for that project once it gets underway.

Cheers,

Collin a.k.a. Thefuzzyman
